  <h2>What is a "Self Pidyon"?</h2>
  <p>Redemption of the firstborn is an important mitzvah from from the Torah which calls on a father to redeem a
    firstborn son by paying 5 silver shekels to a Kohen.</p>
  <p>Sometimes however, due to a number of circumstances this doesn't happen, and when the firstborn turns 13, the
    obligation then falls upon himself to Redeem himself. IE. A "Self Pidyon"</p>
  <p>This site provides information on how to conduct a Self Pidyon </p>
