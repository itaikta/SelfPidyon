    <p class="nusach comment">The Firstborn declares:</p>
    <p class="nusach">I am the firstborn; the first fruit of the womb, and HaShem has decreed that the firstborn shall be redeemed (if the father passed away: 
        and to my sorrow, my father passed before I was redeemed), and I was left with the obligation to redeem myself, as it is written: You shall redeem
        your firstborn, vekarinan tipada, which is to say that I should redeem myself. An here I am! Set and ready to do as such!</p>

    <p class="nusach comment">The Kohen asks:</p>
    <p class="nusach">What would you prefer? yat garmech or to give me five silver sla'im befurkan'h?</p>
    <br />

    <p class="nusach comment">Answers the Firstborn:</p>
    <p class="nusach">yat garmi, and for you, five silver sla'im.</p>
    <br />

    <p class="nusach comment">The first born makes these two blessings:</p>
    <p class="nusach">baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech ha'olam asher kidshanu bemitzotav vetzivanu al pidion habchor</p>
    <p class="nusach">baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech ha'olam shehechayanu vekiamanu vehigi'anu lazman hazeh</p>
    <br />

    <p class="nusach comment">The Kohen now takes the coins and blesses the firstborn in the regular manner</p>
